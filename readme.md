For doing this task, I chose Python over any other language because firstly, I have a good command over Python, and secondly, I don’t have the required knowledge to perform the given task using C.

Now, while doing this task, the problems I faced were as follows:
1)	I didn’t have sufficient knowledge of APIs. I had a basic knowledge of web scraping using BeautifulSoup, but I found it difficult to perform the task using my knowledge of web scraping using Python.
2)	I studied about APIs from the Udemy course on Python.

This course helped me a lot in learning about APIs and how they work, how to extract data from APIs and other things.
3)	Using the logging module to store each and every step of functioning was my own idea. I thought of this so that it would be easier to catch if the program fails to compile at some point.


The complete program is not copied from any source. I just looked into Google to find an API which provides weather information.
